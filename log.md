# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: December 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on
freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I struggle to come up with small code projects.  I have a few that I want to work on, but in my interest to practice Agile -- defining user stories and all that -- they seem to have grown to the point where I feel I'm not ready to start working on them.  I kind of feel like I need to stop planning and just start working on them.  Start with something small - just a basic interface for the core functionality - build from there.  Then I'll at least have something to show, and that's the whole point of this exercise, right?

### Day 2: December 30, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a task planning/logging app.  Have a very rough layout put together, but no behavior yet.

**Thoughts**: I decided to use Firebase for network storage and static hosting.  For now, it just means hosting.  I want to implement authentication, so it'll help with that.  I also decided to pull in Polymer for custom elements, but I'm limiting how much I go crazy with it here.  Instead, I'm going to rely on Bootstrap and save Polymer for when I want to reuse an element.

### Day 3: December 31, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on task planning/logging app.  The Add Activity button now actually does something, and the "selected date" is automatically set to the current day when loaded.  Also added table column spacing.

**Thoughts**: I think I'm done with Bootstrap on this project -- I'm just not getting the look I'm picturing for the app.  I have in mind a digital replacement for a paper planner, but this just looks like I mess of Bootstrap text boxes...
