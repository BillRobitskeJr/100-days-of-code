# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**

Began work on a bookkeeping REST API - I'm going to be intentional about adhering to behavior-driven development with this project.  So far, so good.

**Thoughts**

Live streaming my work is a bit fun, especially when I have to call myself out on my typos.  "There is not 'c' in that word!"

### Day 2: July 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**

Implemented POST-ing new accounts to the server.

**Thoughts**

Things when pretty smoothly tonight.  Not really a whole lot to say...

### Day 3: July 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**

Implemented GET-ing a single accounts resource via GET /api/accounts/:id and added links.self URLs to returned accounts resources when GET-ing or POST-ing to /api/accounts or GET-ing /api/accounts/:id.

**Thoughts**

Something's causing my keyboard to freak out occasionally, which leads to me spamming the keyboard for a moment to get it to type anything.  Not really a programming issue, but it is definitely an annoyance *while* programming.  Also, my stream kept seeming to drop tonight.  I'm not yet sure if it was a fluke, or if there's something wrong with my connection.  Perhaps I have finally outgrew my bandwidth.  (Now, if I only trusted Comcast to give me more bandwidth than I'm *supposed* to get now, that'd be great...)

On the actual programming front, I am continuing to find behavior-driven development greatly useful.  Even if I don't really have anything to *show* for my efforts - no fancy front end, or standing server, etc - I can still incrementally verify that my code is serving its purpose.  It's not quite minimum viable product, but it's minimum "visible" product...?

Now, if I could just figure out how to automate my front-end testing...
