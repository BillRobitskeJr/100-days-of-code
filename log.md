# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**

Began work on a bookkeeping REST API - I'm going to be intentional about adhering to behavior-driven development with this project.  So far, so good.

**Thoughts**

Live streaming my work is a bit fun, especially when I have to call myself out on my typos.  "There is not 'c' in that word!"
